# Predicting-House-Prices-A-Linear-Regression-Approach
Built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features like area, rooms, and amenities. The project involved data preprocessing (handling missing values and encoding categorical variables), training the model, and evaluating performance using MSE and R-squared. Visualized actual vs predicted prices.
